## ðŸ“± Mobile Devices Activity - Components & UseState

- Create a new project using Expo with the TypeScript blank template, and inside it, create a folder named "components".

- In the "components" folder, create a Function Component called "Login.tsx". You can use the "rnf" shortcut if you have this extension installed in VSCode.

- Import the "Login.tsx" component into the main component ("App.tsx") and add it inside the View so that it is rendered.

- In the "Login.tsx" component, create two TextInput fields, each with its own useState. Name them "username" and "password".

- ðŸ’¡ Tip: Check the TextInput documentation to understand how it works.

- ðŸ’¡ Tip: For the password field, you can use the "secureTextEntry" prop to hide the input details on the screen.

- Ensure that the text input works properly and that the values are being stored in their respective useState variables.

- Finally, add a Button in the "Login.tsx" component, and make sure that tapping this button prints the "username" and "password" state values in the terminal (console.log).

- Implement the activity as described, host the solution in a public GitHub repository, and submit the link on Moodle.

- During one of the classes, present your solution to the professor.
